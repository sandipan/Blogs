#### Solving 1st and 2nd order ODEs with Euler¬†method {#b4e0 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--h3 .graf--subtitle name="b4e0"}

In this article, the simplest numeric method, namely the Euler method to
solve 1st order ODEs will be demonstrated with examples (and then use it
to solve 2nd order ODEs). Also, we shall see how to plot the phase lines
(gradient fields) for an ODE and understand from examples how to
qualitatively find a solution curve with the phaselines. All the
problems are taken from the **edx Course: MITx‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää18.03x: Introduction to
Differential Equations**.

Let‚Äôs implement the following R functions to draw the isoclines and the

Now, let‚Äôs plot the 0 (the nullcline), 1, 2, 3 isoclines for the ODE:
*y‚Äô = y.sin(x)*.

Now, let‚Äôs solve the ODE with Euler‚Äôs method, using step size *h = 0.1*
with the initial value *y(-3) = 1*.

``` {#ebcd .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="ebcd"}
l <- 0.2
```

``` {#ef8a .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="ef8a"}
xgap <- 0.05 #05
```

``` {#04a8 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="04a8"}
ygap <- 0.05 #05
```

``` {#286d .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="286d"}
p <- plot_phaselines(f, rx, ry, xgap, ygap, l, -1:1, TeX('phaselines and m-isoclines for $\\frac{dy}{dx} = y.sin(x)$'))
```

``` {#5ada .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="5ada"}
df <- Euler(f, -3, 1, 0.1, 100)
```

``` {#2249 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="2249"}
p + geom_point(aes(Xn, Yn), data=df) + geom_path(aes(Xn, Yn), arrow = arrow(), data=df)
```

The black curve in the following figure shows the solution path with
Euler.

Let‚Äôs plot the phase lines for the ODE *y‚Äô = y\^2‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääx*, solve it with
Euler and plot the solution curve again, using the following code.

The black solution curve shows the trajectory of the solution obtained
with Euler.

Finally, let‚Äô plot the isoclines for the ODE *y‚Äô = y\^2‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääx\^2* and
solve it with Euler. Let‚Äôs try starting with different initial values
and observe the solution curves in each case.

``` {#3ffc .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="3ffc"}
f <- function(x, y) {  return(y^2-x^2)}
```

``` {#3b8b .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="3b8b"}
rx <- c(-4,4)ry <- c(-4,4)l <- 0.2xgap <- 0.1ygap <- 0.1
```

``` {#4e7f .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="4e7f"}
p <- plot_phaselines(f, rx, ry, xgap, ygap, l, -2:2, TeX('phaselines and m-isoclines for $\\frac{dy}{dx} = y^2-x^2$, solving with Euler with diff. initial values'))
```

``` {#b733 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="b733"}
df <- Euler(f, -3.25, 3, 0.1, 100)p <- p + geom_point(aes(Xn, Yn), data=df) + geom_path(aes(Xn, Yn), arrow = arrow(), data=df)
```

As can be seen, the solution curve starting with different initial
values lead to entirely different solution paths, it depends on the
phase lines and isoclines it gets trapped into.

Finally, let‚Äôs notice the impact of the step size on the solution
obtained by the Euler method, in terms of the error and the number of
iterations taken to obtain the solution curve. As can be seen from the
following animation, with bigger step size h=0.5, the algorithm
converges to the solution path faster, but with much higher error
values, particularly for the initial iterations. On the contrary,
smaller step size h=0.1 taken many more iterations to converge, but the
error rate is much smaller, the solution curve is pretty smooth and
follows the isoclines without any zigzag movement.

### Spring-mass-dashpot system‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe Damped Harmonic Oscillator {#8b1e .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--figure name="8b1e"}

A spring is attached to a wall on its left and a cart on its right. A
dashpot is attached to the cart on its left and the wall on its right.
The cart has wheels and can roll either left or right.

The spring constant is labeled *k*, the mass is labeled *m*, and the
damping coefficient of the dashpot is labeled b. The center of the cart
is at the rest at the location *x* equals 0, and we take rightwards to
be the positive *x* direction.

Consider the spring-mass-dashpot system in which mass is*m*(kg), and
spring constant is *k* (Newton per meter). The position *x(t)* (meters)
of the mass at (seconds) is governed by the DE

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*_yNb1Zos9cr6oNrP)

where m, b, k \> 0. Let‚Äôs investigate the effect of the damping
constant, on the solutions to the DE.

The next animation shows how the solution changes for different values
of ùëè, given ùëö=1 and ùëò=16, with couple of different initial values ¬©.

Now, let‚Äôs observe how the amplitude of the system response increases
with the increasing frequency of the input sinusoidal force, achieving
the peak at resonance frequency (for *m=1*, *k=16* and *b=‚àö14*, the
resonance occurs at *wr = 3*)

### Solving the 2nd order ODE for the damped Harmonic Oscillator with Euler¬†method {#07eb .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--figure name="07eb"}

Now, let‚Äôs see how the 2nd order ODE corresponding to the damped
Harmonic oscillator system can be numerically solved using the Euler
method. In order to be able to use Euler, we need to represent the 2nd
order ODE as a collection of 1st order ODEs and then solve those 1st
order ODEs simultaneously using Euler, as shown in the following figure:

Let‚Äôs implement a numerical solver with Euler for a 2nd order ODE using
the following R code snippet:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*T0yXfFDnWKiBKrlBtOGM-w.png)

For the damped Harmonic Oscillator, we have the 2nd order ODE

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*fACWEmX49u4wVV7O)

from which we get the following two 1st order ODEs:

Let‚Äôs solve the damped harmonic oscillator with Euler method:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LbPi3INsuc--gQpjZGxIEQ.png)

Now, let‚Äôs plot the solution curves using the following R code block:

``` {#ee09 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="ee09"}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
```

``` {#2209 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="2209"}
plot(df$tn, df$xn, main="x(t) vs. t", xlab='t', ylab='x(t)',       col='red', pch=19, cex=0.7, xaxs="i", yaxs="i")lines(df$tn, df$xn, col='red')grid(10, 10)
```

``` {#e3d1 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="e3d1"}
plot(df$tn, df$un, main=TeX('$\\dot{x}(t)$ vs. t'), xlab='t',      ylab=TeX('$\\dot{x}(t)$'), col='blue', pch=19, cex=0.7,      xaxs="i", yaxs="i")lines(df$tn, df$un, col='blue')grid(10, 10)
```

Oscillator:

As can be seen from the above results, using the Euler method we can
solve ODEs of any order, as long as we can represent the system as a
collection of 1st order ODEs. There are more accurate methods for
solving ODEs (e.g., the RK-4 method) than Euler method (also known an
1st order Runge-Kutta method) that produces much lower error in
approximation (e.g., RK-4 has global error of O(h‚Å¥)), we can use them to
obtain more accurate approximation of the solution curve.
